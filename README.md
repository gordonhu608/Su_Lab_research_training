Computer vision research prepare and training (This repo only include vision part not robotics part)
Only in the reports folder, some reports are from his graduate level class CSE291 (Machine Learning Meets Geometry) homework works. Otherwise all the work was aiming for research training at my own time. 
The paper fold listed most but not all papers I read for this field. Many of them contain my highlights and notes.
